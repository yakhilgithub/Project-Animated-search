-- A modern and interactive search form with a sleek design.

 Quick breakdown:

HTML: Sets up the page, centering things and making a cool input box with a circular search button.

CSS: Adds style, like a warm background, smooth input, and a snazzy button. The footer hangs out at the bottom.

JavaScript: Makes the search bar interactive, so it grows when you click the button.

Search in style! ðŸŒŸ
